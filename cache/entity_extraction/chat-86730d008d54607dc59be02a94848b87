The characters in this epic face many dilemmas and challenges that force them to make difficult decisions based on their understanding of dharma.\nKarma (Action): Another major topic in the Mahabharata is that every action has repercussions, both in this life and in those to come. The idea of karma is utilised to explain both the good and negative things that happen to the characters in the epic as they struggle with the results of their deeds.#\nFree Will vs. Fate: Mahabharata tackles conflict between free will and fate, with characters occasionally finding it difficult to bring the two together. The epic argues that although individuals may have some influence over their choices, there are more powerful forces at play that eventually determine their fate.\nNature of Human Existence: The Mahabharata dives deeply into the nature of human existence, posing queries about what it is to live, why we suffer, and how important love and connections are to our existence.\nThe characters in the epic grapple with a variety of moral and ethical decisions that have far-reaching effects. For instance, Yudhishthira must decide between keeping his honour and carrying out his responsibilities as a monarch and ensuring the safety of his family when he is offered to gamble away his kingdom and his brothers. In the Kurukshetra conflict, Arjuna also wrestles with the moral choice of fighting against members of his own family.\n\nNumerous lessons from the Mahabharata are still applicable today\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
